# Rogue Pickings
This is a simple website practice project (unresponsive). So far, it's only the home page that's completed. This is a practice project from my HTML/CSS course. I plan on expanding it by adding pages, but that will be reserved for another time.

## Built with...
- HTML(5)
- CSS

## Future plans
- Add new sections with dummy content
- Make the site responsive/mobile-friendly
- Convert to flexbox or CSS grid

## Live versions
- [Live](https://adrianne.dev/projects/roguepickings)
